			Hello my name is Coleman Katen, I took this class because I used to consider myself a master in computers. One time the 
			wifi went out in my house and I fixed it by unplugging the cables then plugging them back in. After the first few assignments I learned that I was
			not a computer master I was barely a computer novice. But I am so thankful for everything I have learned in this class.
			I hope to educate my family and friends I took this class for more personal reasons rather than career based reasons but I do believe that 
			I could set up a website for my family if they asked. My dad is a carpenter and his work should really be put on display and I believe now that I have the ability to help showcase his work.
