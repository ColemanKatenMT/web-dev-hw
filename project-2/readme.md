## Project 2
Goodness HTML it has been fun I honestly feel like it was just yesterday I was making my first read me and now look at me 
I completed project 2 I really put my best foot forward and fell like I gave it 100%. Learning what all the diferent symbols on 
my computer do was kind of a plase the arrows and slashes mean a lot more to me now then they did when I first started and all in
all I didn't know what to expect but now that I have finished it, it all seems doable.

Oh boy, CSS I feel like I don't know what to expect most comparably I have the same what feels inocent feeling twords CSS as 
I did with HTML but after fininshing HTML I might want to start feeling like a sheep being lead to well hopefully a nice green 
pastor but we will see.

As far as my work cycle went this assignment was just a lot of regurgitating things that we have learned in the prior weeks and I 
think that the two hardest things that I had to do for this assignment was just finding time to sit down and type this bad boy out 
and the second hardest thing was finding something that I wanted to make a website for.

I didnt really have any issues it was pretty smooth sailing but if I had to choose the hardest thing was finding something to make a how to about.
