				<center><h2>Introduction</h2></center>
				<center><p>Summer is finnaly here and now you are looking for somthing to do, something to remember this summer by<br/>
				and after personally living through 22 summers myself I believe that I am qualified to teach you how to live<br/>
				your best summer now. Like with all my webpages I'd like to start off with a little joke, and in light of summer<br/>
				vacation I want to know if salmon go on vacation too? This may seem a little fishy to you guys but no they can't<br/>
				because they're always in school.<br/></center>

				<h2>How to Make the Most out of your Material</h2>
				<p>Now that we have our water supplies we need to know what to do with them. This is the tricky part, first we need to unattach
				ourselves from all electronics.<i> At first you may feel a little woozy but that will pass, that's just real life that you are taking in.</i> 
				<center><img src=".\images\phones.jpg"/><br/></center>
				Next you need to fill up all the water guns and water balloons that you can get your hands on. Hoses are not needed but they do make life 
				easier, faucets can be found all along the outside of your house spin the tops to get water to come out, then use the water to fill up your water
				toys.

				Now that we have all our water weapons its time to head down to the river where we can finally get this summer started.  Call up all your friends 
				tell them to meet you down at the river you guys are going to have a picnic. (<i>Don't worry if you dont have friends this is just like field of
				dreams "If you bring them they will come."</i>) Show up to the river with a truck full of water guns and watermelon you our bound to make some
				life long friends you will be crowned the king of summer. If you do not have a waterbed go ahead and rinse and repeat the steps listed above and 
				hold that crown tight you good looking summer King/Queen you. But if you do have the water bed lets go on ahead and kick this thing up a notch. Stay tuned.

				For everyone who took the extra step and got the waterbed just cause it had the word water in it props to you I really didn't plan this far ahead, but dont worry I 
				have never been the type to disappoint. We are already down at the river so I say and I am just playing this by ear, but lets fill that bad boy up with air.
				this may take a second I realize you may want to go to a gas station and use their air pumps but once you get that bad boy filled up lets go ahead and throw it on 
				the water and swim down stream a little with 3 of your best buddies. You will be the captain and thats what people need to address you by Captain, I mean it is your water bed.
				Then you need a first mate everyone will call him Schmitty, a look out his name can be Isacc and a person to stear you his name can just be Doug.
