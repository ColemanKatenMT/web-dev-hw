<h1>Process</h1>
my main browser that I use is Google Chrome. It is fast user friendly and I have never had a problem with it.
Growing up we had the worst internet partially because we grew up out on a dirt road, so internet was never 
really a priority there was always something better to do. In High School however we needed a browser and 
internet explorer was way to slow and it seemed that firefox wasn't to much faster and when I got Chrome it
turned into a whole new world. Browsers are a very complex concept, I like to think that we have the brain 
as your browser and then each thought that you can have is a website. In the websies we have different 
memories and those memories are considered to a website to be called cookies and they remember all your
passwords and your activity on your browser. Using the wayback machine was very fun in 2000 I was only 5, so
hardly much older than the internet.I ran into my first problem when I went to find a website the only thing
I remember going on when I was young was a few gaming websites, even youtube is only 13 years old.  I did 
happen to stuble on mtv.com and that was created in the 90's and has really changed a lot since then, I 
recognize the people who came up on the most recent mtv page. However when the internet was first being 
developed you can see the learning curve that needed to happen,everything is in a sort of in a chronological 
order search at the top headlines here a few moving pictures, but now we are so advanced we have pictures with 
Titles for everything and a lot more complex to navigate but we have adapted and are really asking for more.
My work cycle for this project was not very user friendly I had to get new browsers, I needed to email github for
help then finally I had to take my computer in to get help to try to create an html.  I did end up figuring it out
and it has been very easy sailing since then.
