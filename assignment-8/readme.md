##Assignment 7
for this assignment I wanted to do some halloween colors to go along with the shining because it is one of the scariest books
I have ever seen. I am not much of a reader but I do love movies, and it is one of my families favorite movies.

The fonts that I choose to use I looked up but unfortunatally it doesnt seem like they are working very well.

During this week I have been really busting my butt to get as much done as fast as I could cause I do want to get
credit for everything that I can get done. but if I have time I would like to come back and work through some of the material again.
