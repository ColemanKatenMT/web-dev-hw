##Assignment 8
because padding, margin and boarders are all essentially relatives to each other it is important to know the differences and how they relate. boarders go around entire pieces and inside the boarder you have the margin and that tells 
you how close or how much space youd like from the boarder and finally the padding is the invisable area around content.
As far as this assignmen goes during the whole semester I felt like I was pinched for time becasue of the funeral that I needed to go to and between this class and work I felt a very big 
time managmen issue and it really caught up to me on this assignment but as far as what I got done I had a lot of trouble with the background image I choose I wanted it to be 
transparent and centered in the middle of my page then essentiall my info would go on top but I couldn't get it to work so I just went with the solid color background.
This assignment being so close to the end and the pinch for time that I had I just googled what I could and got it on the page and here is my unfinished project I will finish it however on my own time.
