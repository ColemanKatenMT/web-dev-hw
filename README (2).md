# My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo

## Coleman Katen

I have decided to take this class because when I was younger I had the opportunity to take a website development class at a camp in Helena, and
I really took to it.  Then in high school I took a blogger class but it wasn't the same as the coding that I enjoyed so much at camp. In all I am
really looking forward to rekindle the passion that I had for web development here.

But what exactly is the internet? What really intrigued me was:

- The ocean is a great way to describe what our internet really is it's deep and vast, heck we even surf the web.
- One other fact that I am still trying to wrap my head around is that we have dug into the ocean and placed wires down to connect all our cities, towns, and villages to one another.
- Finally the last thing worth mentioning that I learned was that to keep from getting lost each modem puts a unique wrapper on each message sent out and when the item gets sent back it needs to unwrap itself going through
the same modems to get back to my computer. It was very fascinating.
