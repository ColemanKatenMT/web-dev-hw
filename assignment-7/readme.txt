As far as history went I think that the most of our advancments were made in the 60's, and when people refer to making America great again 
I believe that they are talking about the 60's. I choose the spacy background because it was the decade when we obviouslmade it to the Moon and I thought theat it was relatable.

My color scheme for this assignment was the space background and then to be able to see I wanted to use marroon.  

My work cycle for this assignment was very hecticI felt like I was drowning in material and really felt like I didn't
really make any advancments this week and I saw a picture that summed up how I felt this week and I said that my code isn't working and 
I don't know why then right below that it was the same picture and it said my code is working and I don't know why.
