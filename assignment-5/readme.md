## Assignment 5
Divs help you categorize material and seperate them into groups
Classes are used in the same way that divs are used but instead of categorizing material the classes categorize the divs by finding what they have in common with eachother.
id is what gives a certain description to an html element and lets us know what it is used for and in what case.
spans are how we break up divs into their own sub categories.

The reason you would choose a 3rd party site over a self hosted media is becasue the 3rd party site is a way to reach over all web browsers they are in terms of the internet already "decorated" and if you are a begginer a self hosted site might not be as user friendly as a 3rd party hoster.

this assignment was enjoyable it brought mme back to why I started coding which was to like others work like videos and songs into my own site this assignment was very helpful and I learned enough to feel comfortable in starting my own site soon.
