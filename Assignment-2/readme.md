## Assignment 2

A _Version Control System_ is

a fast and easy way to keep track of all the changes and edits you make in a software or in coding it remembers everything you change and has a function for you to include the reason why you changed something.  One really great reason for version control is when collaborating on a piece it tracks all the changes everyone is making and allows all the contributing parties to work on a single piece at one time.  It allows everyone to work on different pieces or even the same piece at one time and then in the end come together for a unified effect.  Lastly version control isn't just a program for beginners even though it is user friendly to those who are just starting out it also grows with the user and is really a one stop shop offering a lot of different tools from beginners to experts.

###  Work Cycle

For this assignment I found very helpful to split it into sections.  My first section was to absorb as much information about repositories as I could I went through the demos first then watched some YouTube videos.  Next I watched the class videos on how data travels and all the things that a document must go through to go from point a to point b and then back to point a again. finally I started in on the assignment things went fairly smooth and when I had a question I was able to look most them up on the website which was very helpful.
