## Assignment 2

A _Version Control System_ is

a fast and easy way to keep track of all the changes and edits you make in a software or in coding it remembers everything you change and has a function for you to include the reason why you changed something.  One really great reason for version control is when collaborating on a piece it tracks all the changes everyone is making and allows all the contributing parties to work on a single piece at one time.  It allows everyone to work on different pieces or even the same piece at one time and then in the end come together for a unified effect.  Lastly version control isn't just a program for beginners even though it is user friendly to those who are just starting out it also grows with the user and is really a one stop shop offering a lot of different tools from beginners to experts.
